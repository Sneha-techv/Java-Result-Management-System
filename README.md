🧩 Assignment Title

Student Result Management System – Exception Handling in Java

🧠 1. Problem Statement

Design and implement a Student Result Management System that:

Collects student details and marks for three subjects.

Validates each subject’s marks to ensure they are within a valid range (0–100).

Calculates and displays the student’s average marks and result (Pass/Fail).

Demonstrates robust exception handling using:

Built-in and custom exceptions

try, catch, throw, throws, and finally blocks

🎯 2. Objectives

Understand and implement Java Exception Handling concepts.

Distinguish between checked and unchecked exceptions.

Learn how to declare and throw exceptions using throw and throws.

Design and use a custom exception (InvalidMarksException).

Use try-catch-finally blocks for robust error handling and resource management.


🧾 3. Conclusion

This assignment successfully demonstrates:

Exception Handling using try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.

Use of custom exceptions (InvalidMarksException) for domain-specific validation.

Robust input validation to prevent invalid marks and input mismatches.

Proper object-oriented design using classes and modular code.

Graceful handling of runtime errors ensuring the application runs smoothly.

Hence, the program fulfills all requirements of Assignment – 3 (Unit 3) for Java Programming
